## The Terminal

There's are a ton of different terminal commands you can use. We'll only cover the basic ones that still will get you pretty effective in the command line.

### Find your terminal

#### Mac OSX

Use the Terminal program, located in your `Applications/Utilities` folder.

Another quick way to start it is by using `cmd + space` then search terminal.

One tip I usually give to everybody that cares to listen, is to change the color profile of the terminal to a dark background. It makes it easier to work in the long run. Open up Settings and change the profile to Pro.

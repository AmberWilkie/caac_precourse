## Wrap it up

Now it is up to you to write the rest of your tests and implement the code you need to make them pass.

At the very end of your development process you want to make a run through an series of numbers and get a similar response as we showed you in the first step of this exercise.

```irb
 $ irb
2.2.0 :001 > load './lib/fizz_buzz.rb'
 => true 
2.2.0 :002 > output = []
 => []
2.2.0 :003 > 100.times {|n| output << fizz_buzz(n)}
```

## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development is the process of using automated tests to drive the design of software. Put simply, the main concept of the process is to write a test first, followed by implementing just enough code to satisfy the test, then a final but important step of refactoring.

This process not only makes sure that the implemented code is fit for its purpose but it also aids you as a developer in thinking about the design of the code you write. It keeps the focus on small iterative steps that collectively build solid functionality and ultimately result in solid, working software.

* Acceptance tests - check the entire stack
* Integration tests - check two or more components
* Unit tests - check a single component

## Fizz-Buzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.  Players take turns counting up from one, replacing any number that is divisible by three with the word 'fizz', any number divisible by five with the word 'buzz', and any number divisible by both three and five to be replaced with 'fizz buzz'.

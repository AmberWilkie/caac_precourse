# Soft Skills

Apart from the technical skills that we work with during the camp, we also focus an another side of the professional profile of our students. 

### Holistic attitude
Although in-depth knowledge of a particular programming language or system is important, an ability to look at the overall structure and understand the writing and rebuilding of different applications, not only from a technical but also from an business perspective, is highly sought by the market.

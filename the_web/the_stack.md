## The stack
During the Craft Academy Bootcamp we will be working with technologies across the entire stack behind a web application. Let's just quickly go over the differences and their meaning.

### Front End
The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you're navigating a website, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus, sliders and forms. The front end is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript controlled by your computer's browser.

#### Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

### Back end
The back end of a website consists of a server, an application and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components that enables the front end side of a website to even exist in the first place.

#### Technologies used
* PHP
* Ruby
* Python
* Java
* .Net
* SQL (MySql, Postgres, etc.)
* NoSQL (MongoDB)

### Full stack
Full stack developers work mostly on the server side of web programming, but they can also speak the front-end languages that control how content looks on a web site's user-facing side. 

At Craft Academy we've chosen Ruby, with all its access to a wide array of frameworks and tools, as the first back end language we introduce to students. For front end development, we will be using Javascript  with accompanying frameworks that makes development of rich applications possible - both for a desktop and mobile user experience (AngularJS and Ionic).

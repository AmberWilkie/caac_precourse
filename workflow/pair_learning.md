## Pair Learning
Pair Programming is an software development technique in which two programmers work together on one feature or problem set - often at one workstation. Used as part of a general teamwork approach it leads to improved code quality, team communication, knowledge share and huge learning gains.

At Craft Academy, we practice Pair Programming as a learning technique.

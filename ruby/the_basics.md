## The basics

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.

### Dynamic
Dynamic programming language is a term used in computer science to describe a class of high-level programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. Popular dynamic programming languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP.

### Reflective
Reflective in this context means that a program is able to examine and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.  It allows for a program to be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

### Object-oriented
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as **attributes**; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as **methods**. Ruby is also class-based, meaning that objects are instances of **classes**, and ruby programs are designed by making them out of classes or instances of classes that interact with one another. In Ruby every value is an object even the simplest things such as numbers, strings, false, true and so on.

### General-purpose
In computer software a general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used in a wide variety of application domains. In many ways a general-purpose language only has this status because it does not include language constructs designed to be used within a specific application domain.

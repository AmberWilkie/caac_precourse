## The basics

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.

### Dynamic
Dynamic programming language is a term used in computer science to describe a class of high-level programming languages which, at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. Popular dynamic programming languages include JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP.

### Reflective
Reflective in this context means that a program is able to examine and modify its own structure and behavior (specifically the values, meta-data, properties and functions) at runtime.Reflection is a valuable language feature to facilitate metaprogramming.  It allows for a program to be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

### Object-Oriented
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" - **classes**, which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as **attributes**; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as **methods**. 

### General-Purpose
